## UX

  

### Project Goals

### Design

  
**Fonts**

Used the font Lato for a proifessional and clean look


**Colours**

Went with a white base colour to keep everything looking clean and allow images to pop out and black to give a nice contrasting look 


**Topography**

The site uses bootstrap 4 be responsive across devices, also media queries were used to change how the intro text appears across different devices to provide a smooth user experience.

### Wireframes

WireFrames were created using Figma at recomendation of my tutor. https://www.figma.com/  
they can be found here [wireframes(Wirframes/readme) 
The original design that was chosen was too similar to the Boutique ado project and while i am very fond of the simple design things where changed to make it stand out and look different

-  [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io)
This project uses **StackEdit** to build the markdown for this readme file

 
  
  

## Testing

  

Testing was done incrementaly and influnced the end result of the project.

  
I tested the python code with https://extendsclass.com/python-tester.html and came back with no syntax errors 
CCS was tested with https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ there where 2 warnings but i have chosen to ignore these as they cause no problems
the html validator https://validator.w3.org/ showed up multiple errors as the techincque to create templates was casuing flags these where ignored.

  

When the project was fully completed i went through the below testing scenarios to further test the project to make sure that it reached my goal.


![Responsive Design](/wirframes/Responsivness.png)




Main problems that where run into was a server error 500 upon making an account the issue was happening when the change to the 
verification page the accounts where being created with no verification needed and it was causing a server 500 error with no email being sent, after pinpointing the location of the problem the issue turned out to be a simple synatax error that has gotten lost in the code after fixing that the problem was solved and it worked as intended 


Testing Steps:

Checking the email and verification system, using temp mail i made many account testing and retesting all of the log out and account creation functions at each stage of development i would create an account and check that everything was working as intended 

Testing Useabliltiy' on multiple devices using the google developer tools i used all of the features on the site to make sure everything was working as intended 





## Deployment

I personally used vscode on my local machine to develop the site using Python 3.7.3  and deployed to Heroku via Github.

1. To download or clone the site to your local machine you will need to go to (https://github.com/OriHillairetdev/Milestone-project-3) see steps in https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository .
2. Before you download or clone the site you will need to ensure you have [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. 
3. Once you have Python installed, created a virtual environment as appropriate to you chosen IDE and os.
4. Run the requirements.txt file as appropriate to your IDE to install the relevant required packages dependencies for the project into your virtual environment.
5. Run the app.py file as appropriate to your chosen environment and os.
6. You should now be able to view the site on your localhost on port 5000.
